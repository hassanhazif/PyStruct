# Bar Convention

for bar arrangmeent notations, use of arrays should be done for layers

- Information must contain the number of bars within a layer, the diameter of bars in each layer, and the seperation of bars in the layer
- If possible, need to find a solution without using defined layers of the bar, making it possible to use multiple depth values for circular section caclulations
