# Beams

## Design Procedure
1. Determine design life
2. Assess actions on the slab
3. Determine which combinations of actions apply
4. Determine loading arrangements
5. Assess durability requirements and determine concrete strength
6. Check cover requirements for appropriate fire resistance period
7. Calculate min. cover for durability, fire and bond requirements
8. Analyse structure to obtain critical moments and shear forces
9. Desing flexural reinforcement
10. Check deflection
11. Chech shear capacity
12. Check spacing of bars
13. Check crack control

## Flexural design

### Design Compressive strength

$$ f_{cd} = \alpha_{cc}f_{ck}/\gamma_{c} = 0.567f_{ck} $$

$ f_{cd}$ - Design compressive strength

$ \gamma_{Mc} $ - partial safety factor for concrete = 1.5

$ \alpha_{cc} $ - the coefficient taking account of long term effects on the compressive strength and of unfavourable effects resulting from the way the load is applied. default value = 0.85 in uk NA

## Crack control
> EC2-1 - Clause 7.3.2

This is where the mid-height reinforcement in beams come from
